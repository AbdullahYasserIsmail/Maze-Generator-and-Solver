Welcome to the "Maze Generator and Solver" project. 
The goal of this python project was to create a maze and solve it using the following search algorithms:
1- DFS
2- BFS
3- A*
The prim's algorithm was successfully used to generate a maze, and the previously mentioned algorithms were utilized to solve this maze.
Also, our team made sure that the user will have the best experience when running the program as we implemented a clear GUI code as part of the program.

To run the project, simply download the ".py" file from the repository and run it. Please make sure you have the necessary modules installed like pygame.
For the purpose of illustration, you will find a video, as well as a ppt file that goes through each process inside the project.
